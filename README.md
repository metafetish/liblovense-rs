# lovesense - DEPRECATED

**This repository is deprecated. Please use the [buttplug-rs library](https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-rs) instead.**


[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/metafetish/lovesense-rs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/metafetish/lovesense-rs) [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/34jyv6e0w32korfj?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/qdot/lovesense-rs) [![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/lovesense.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/lovesense)

lovesense is a library for controlling Lovense sex toys, such as the
Max, Nora, and Lush. The library allows users to control all aspects
of the toy (vibration/rotation/inflation, depending on the toy), as
well as retrieving information like device type, status, battery
level, and accelerometer readings.

The library is currently available in the following languages:

- [Python](http://github.com/metafetish/lovesense-py)
- [Max/MSP](http://github.com/metafetish/lovesense-max)
- [Rust (with C Headers)](http://github.com/metafetish/lovesense-rs)
- [Javascript](http://github.com/metafetish/lovesense-js)

If you need an implementation in a language not currently supported by
lovesense, please file an issue on the github tracker of the relevant
project.

Please note that this project has no direct relation to the Lovense
company. These drivers have been developed/supported by the open
source community. Lovense has had no direct participation in this
project and most likely will not be able to answer questions or
provide support for any of the Lovesense drivers. 

If you require commercial support for programming for Lovense
products, it is recommended you go through the
[Official Lovense Developer Program](https://www.lovense.com/sextoys/developer).

## Rust Library

The Rust version of lovesense requires the serial-rs library, which
is listed in the Cargo file.

## C Headers

Once the Rust library is compiled, C headers are included that allow
the library to be linked and used from C/C++. See in the "include"
directory.

## Protocol Explanation

Lovense toys connect via bluetooth, and then use the Serial Port
Profile (SPP) to communicate with the host. This means that the toys
are exposed as either COM Ports (windows) or tty devices
(posix/bsd/etc). 

### Protocol Rules

* Commands and replies are strings, using semicolons to mark their end.
* All commands start with a command identifier word, then possibly
  either specifiers or levels, delimited by colons. e.g. "Vibrate:5;"
  would set vibration to 5.
* Replies are in the context of the command (i.e. sending "Battery;"
  will just return a number, like "85;"), but can still be colon
  delimited lists.

### Command Table

The following is the known command table for all toys. Anything send
or received over the serial port is in quotes to denote communication,
but should not be sent using quotes if you are implementing your own
version of this protocol. Commands with ":x" mean that the x should be
replaced with a number, the range of which is mentioned in the
description.

## Thanks

Thanks to [PenTest Partners](https://www.pentestpartners.com/) for
doing most of the heavy lifting and
[documenting it in their blog](https://www.pentestpartners.com/blog/dicking-around-with-dildos-how-to-drive-a-vibrator-with-realterm/).
This library is mostly just an implementation of the information found
in that post.
